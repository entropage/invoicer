# GraphQL Features Test Plan

## 1. Infrastructure Tests
1. GraphQL Server Setup
   - Verify GraphQL endpoint is accessible
   - Confirm GraphQL playground is working
   - Test introspection queries
   - Validate schema structure

2. Authentication Integration
   - Test authenticated vs unauthenticated requests
   - Verify token handling
   - Check session persistence

## 2. User Profile Features
1. Profile Data Model
   ```graphql
   # Example query to test
   query {
     userProfile(id: "user_id") {
       id
       email
       preferences
       sensitiveData
     }
   }
   ```
   - Verify profile creation
   - Test profile data retrieval
   - Validate sensitive information storage
   - Check profile update operations

2. IDOR Test Cases
   - Access profile by incrementing user IDs
   - Retrieve other users' sensitive data
   - Modify other users' preferences
   - Test nested queries for unauthorized access

## 3. Invoice Sharing Features
1. Basic Invoice Operations
   ```graphql
   # Example mutation to test
   mutation {
     shareInvoice(invoiceId: "inv_id", userId: "target_user") {
       success
       sharedWith {
         id
         email
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   - Create invoice sharing relationships
   - Test share revocation
   - Verify collaboration features
   - Validate comment system

2. IDOR Test Cases
   - Access unshared invoices
   - Modify invoices without permission
   - Traverse between users via shared invoices
   - Exploit nested relationships

## 4. GraphQL Specific Tests
1. Query Depth and Complexity
   - Test nested query limits
   - Verify query complexity restrictions
   - Check field-level permissions

2. Batch Operations
   - Test multiple operation handling
   - Verify transaction consistency
   - Check error propagation

## 5. Vulnerability Verification
1. Authorization Bypass Tests
   ```graphql
   # Example exploit query
   query {
     invoice(id: "other_user_invoice") {
       id
       amount
       owner {
         id
         email
         sensitiveData
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   - Document successful IDOR exploits
   - Map vulnerable query paths
   - Test authorization bypass methods

2. Data Exposure Tests
   - Verify sensitive data leakage
   - Test object relationship traversal
   - Check unauthorized nested queries

## 6. Performance Tests
1. Query Performance
   - Measure response times
   - Test with varying query complexity
   - Check resource utilization

2. Load Testing
   - Test concurrent requests
   - Verify rate limiting
   - Check error handling under load

## 7. Test Automation
1. Test Scripts
   ```bash
   # Example test structure
   describe('GraphQL IDOR Tests', () => {
     it('should not allow access to other user profiles', async () => {
       // Test implementation
     });
   });
   ```
   - Unit tests for resolvers
   - Integration tests for workflows
   - Automated vulnerability checks

2. CI/CD Integration
   - Automated test runs
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Security scan integration

## 8. Documentation Requirements
1. Test Results
   - Document all test cases
   - Record successful exploits
   - Track vulnerability coverage

2. Usage Examples
   - Sample queries and mutations
   - Exploitation proof of concepts
   - Mitigation strategies (for reference only)
