# Bug 001: docker image contains unnecessary files

## Current Situation
The docker image contains unnecessary directories and files that bloat the image size:
1. `.git` directory - Contains version control history which is not needed for running the application
2. `test` directory - Contains test files which are only needed during development
3. `.cursorrules` - IDE configuration file not needed in production
4. `docs` directory - Documentation not needed for runtime
5. Other development files like `.env.example`, etc.

## Impact
1. Increased image size leading to:
   - Longer pull times
   - More storage usage
   - Increased attack surface due to unnecessary files
2. Potential security risks from exposing internal files
3. Reduced deployment efficiency

## Expected Behavior
The docker image should:
1. Contain only runtime-necessary files
2. Exclude all development, test, and documentation files
3. Have optimized layer caching
4. Follow Docker best practices for production images

## Root Cause
The current Dockerfile uses `COPY . /app/` which copies everything from the build context, including unnecessary files and directories.

## Fix Plan

### 1. Update Dockerfile
1. Use multi-stage builds to separate build and runtime environments
2. Add proper `.dockerignore` file
3. Explicitly copy only required files

### 2. Create .dockerignore
Create a `.dockerignore` file with the following exclusions:
- `.git/`
- `test/`
- `docs/`
- `.cursorrules`
- `.env*`
- `*.md`
- `*.log`
- `node_modules/`
- `.vscode/`
- `coverage/`
- `*.test.js`
- `*.spec.js`

### 3. Update Build Process
1. Implement multi-stage Dockerfile:
   ```dockerfile
   # Build stage
   FROM 339713064450.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/entropage/invoicer:latest AS builder
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY package.json yarn.lock ./
   RUN yarn install --production

   # Runtime stage
   FROM 339713064450.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/entropage/invoicer:latest
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
   COPY src/ ./src/
   COPY package.json ./
   
   CMD ["yarn", "run", "dev"]
   ```

### 4. Testing Plan
1. Build new image with changes
2. Verify image size reduction
3. Run application tests to ensure functionality
4. Compare file list in old vs new image
5. Verify all required runtime files are present

### 5. Validation Criteria
- [ ] Image size should be significantly reduced
- [ ] Application runs correctly with all features
- [ ] No unnecessary files in final image
- [ ] Build process completes successfully
- [ ] All layers are properly cached

### 6. Rollout Plan
1. Implement changes in development environment
2. Test thoroughly
3. Update CI/CD pipeline
4. Deploy to staging
5. Monitor for any issues
6. Roll out to production

## Notes
- Keep version tagging consistent with current scheme
- Document any changes in build process
- Update deployment documentation if needed
